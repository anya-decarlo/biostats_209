"advances our understanding of the determinants, outcomes, and amelioration of later life disability"
AIM: Use de-identified electronic health data UCSF to address aging related phenomena that are:
1. Clinically burdensome (frequent hard to manage)
2. Economically draining (Increase LOS, leads to readmission or complications that aren't reimbursed,
require high labor/resource use, labeled hospital acquired condition)
3. Quality-of-life destroying

Options.
1. Delirium
2. Falls(considered preventable CMS 'never events') and Fractures
3. Dementia
4. Incontinence
5. Polypharmacy and Adverse Drug Events
6. Readmissions in Frail Older Adults
7. Pressure Ulcers (Hospital Acquired)
